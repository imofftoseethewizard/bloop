Message Board
=============

The message board provides a simple public message service.  To post a message, the sender
provides the id for the recipient, the length of time the message will be available, the maximum
number of reads allowed, and the contents of the message.  The message board should provide
reasonable defaults for the length of availability (30 days) and maximum number of reads (1).  If
the sender wishes to identify themselves or sign the message, that should be encoded in the
message.  The message board does not attempt to identify the sender nor should it retain any
information about the origin of the message.  The message board must delete the message either
after it has expired, or after it has been read the maximum number of times, whichever comes
first.  Agents may only read messages after they have proved their identity to the message board.
A message board may handle messages for all agents or for a subset of all agents.  If a message
board only handles a subset, it should should have an index of other message boards by range of
agents handled.  The message board should respond to requests for unhandled agents with a
redirection to the appropriate agent.  Coordinators may assign agents to message boards.
Coordinators may also post announcements which are similar to messages, except that they are
broadcast and implicitly single-read per agent.  Messages should be encrypted with the recipient's
public key. Although the message board has no way to check that this has been done, it should be
assumed by recipients that this is the case.  Announcements should be signed by the sender.

An agent may play the role of message board.

Malicious agent behavior: retaining information on senders; retaining messages beyond expiration;
failing to retain messages; delivering messages to unauthorized recipients; failing to deliver
announcements; failing to redirect for unhandled recipients.
