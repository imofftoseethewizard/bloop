Description
-----------

Initial Setup

The user must either transfer a private key to the device, or use the admin application's tools to generate, a principal client/user key. The private client key, since it must exist on all devices, should be password-protected.

The application will also generate an asymmetric device key.

Once the host has approved the client, or if the client has already been approved, the application will retrieve the private admin key from the server or generate an asymmetric admin key pair if the first device the client has registered.

The application will also request configuration data from the server if the client has registered an admin application on another device.

Launch Behavior

The admin application will load the unencrypted private client key, as well as the private device and application keys, into a JavaScript closure for use throughout the session.
